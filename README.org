#+TITLE: ii Install and Configuration of Spac(emacs)

[[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] with a number of [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] packages is at the center of our workflow.
The goal is to help future users of this workflow to get setup with the least amount of frustration and feeling productive.

> Spacemacs is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

* Emacs

Our config seems to work on 26.x releases of emacs, install as appropriate for your OS.
You can follow the directions at the bottom of this document if you want to build from source.

* site-local

To save time we use a site-local folder, usually under ~/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp~ and keep that under version control.

Depending on your machine and internet connection it may take some time to retrieve.
Alternatively you can download a tarball here: LINK

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  sudo git clone --depth 1 --recurse-submodules \
      https://github.com/iimacs/site-lisp \
      /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
  sudo emacs --batch -l /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/default.el
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

* Updates

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cd /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp
  sudo git pull origin master
  sudo git submodule update --recursive
  sudo emacs --batch -l /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/default.el
#+END_SRC
